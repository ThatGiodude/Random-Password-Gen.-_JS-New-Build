# Random-Password-Gen.-_JS-New-Build-Challenge 3

## My Task

I returned to the previous code that I had submitted and decided to go back to the drawing board with what I know now. I updated the Js file to be a bit more streamlined and cleaned up the code that generated the length loop. Now it is more responsive and adheres to the requirements a bit more. As of this latest update, the code utilizes special characters, capital and lowercase letters, numbers and has a variable length that can be adjusted with each input.
